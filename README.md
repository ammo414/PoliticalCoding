## Political Coding

A project to ingest congressional data from the Library of Congress's API and political news from Perignon's News API. The intent is to then contrast the topics of interest for these two groups to find descrepancies.

Uses Airflow to load data daily into a PostGreSQL database (SQL connection is still a to-do).

EDIT: Because my Perignon trial expired, this project is on hold.
